(1) To plot the charge densities (for different types) and to 
 analysis or to be plotted using gnuplot, use: plot_all.f

(2) To plot the atomic structure in gopenmol or viewlit, 
  using conf2xyz.f to convert the atom.config file to atom.xyz file. 

   In gopenmol, use buttons: File -> import -> Coords -> XYZ 
   to import the atom.xyz file (after it is imported, the ball-stick 
   picture will automaticall shown in the display window). 

(3) To plot the density or wavefunction contour in gopenmol, 
   use plot_all2plt.f. First, get a graph.plt_f file. 
   in gopenmol, use buttons: Run -> Pltfile(conversion) [use 
   Formatted ==> Unformatted option]. Get a file graph.plt
   Then, use buttons: Plot -> Contour (first import the file, 
   then select the contour levels and colours) to get the 3D 
   isosurface plot. 

(4) To plot the density of state (DOS) or partial density of state, 
   use plot_DOS.f. First, run PEtot calculation with a large k-point
   set, generate eigen_all.store and wg.out. Run another PEtot, using 
   wg.out as input and iCG=-1 in etot.input. It will generate the
   atomic orbital projection file bpsiiofilexxxxxx. Then run plot_DOS.r
   to get the DOS and partial DOS. To resolve for different atoms, 
   you need to add an additional column in xatom.config file to weight
   the atom.
