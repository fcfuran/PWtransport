This directory includes the norm conserving pseudopotentials for all the elements except the rare earths elements
with f state electrons (which are not supported by the current released version of PEtot). 

The pseudopotentials are generated using Dr. Jose Luis Martins's pseudopotential package:
 http://bohr.inesc-mn.pt/~jlm/jlm.html
 http://bohr.inesc-mn.pt/~jlm/pseudo.html

The pseudopotentials are generated from the atom_table.input parameters without any changes. 

There has been no systematic testing for these pseudopotentials, thus you need to use them with 
cautious. There is no guarantee they are the optimized pseudopotentials, and they will not produce
errors. 

The suggested plane wave energy cutoff for each pseudopotential is written in the first line of 
the pseudopotential file.
