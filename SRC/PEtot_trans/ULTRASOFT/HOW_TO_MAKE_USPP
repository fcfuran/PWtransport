 (0)   You first need to compile the executable runatom.x, and place 
       that in the Bin directory. (if you use IBM SP machine, you don't
       need to recompile, the executable in this package should work 
       for you).    
 (1)   Go to the Work directory under this directory, then go to a 
       element directory (e.g, 031-Ga). Choose a sub directory (i.e., one option
       of the pseudopotential), e.g., 031-Ga-gpw-nsp-campos. In that directory, 
       simply type: ">make", that will make the ultrasoft pseudopotential for 
       you (the Ga_ps.uspp file). 
       Note, you might need to change the ROOT in Makefile to: ROOT=../../.. 
       Type ">make install" to copy the file into the Pot file directory with the proper
       name etc. 

       In the Pot directory, you can run usp_convert.r to convert the binary pseudopotential
       file  yyyyy.uspp to asci file yyyyy.txt. The txt file is what the PEtot will read. 

       If you miss an element, in the Work directory, and you can check the following to 
       see whether there are new update in Dr. D. Vanderbilt's website:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A library of the pseudopotential files (for each element, only one option of pseudopotential
    is choosen) is in USSP_TXT_ALL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (1)   Go to D. Vanderbilt's ultrasoft pp Website: 
       http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/uspp/#CONTRIB
 (2)   Double click on one element of the (green/blue) periodic table. 
 (3)   Now, you might see a few subdirectories, corresponding to a few 
       possible uspp's for this element. Click on the one you like to use 
       (however, for most of the elements, there is only one choice). 
 (4)   Download the Makefile and all the xxx.adat file, and place them 
       in a directory: Work/xxx-atom/xxx-atom-yyy-x-name/. Note xxx_atom (xxx is 
       the atomic number, atom is the atom name, e.g, 047-Ag) is a directory
       for this element; xxx-atom-yyy-x-name is a subdirectory for one particular uspp 
       for this element. The yyy-x-name can be gpw-n-campos, or ca-sp-vgrp, etc. 
       Please check take this name from the website   
       (for example: 047-Ag-gpw-n-campos for xxx-atom-yyy-x-name of Ag.). Note this
       directory structure cannot be changed, since that is used in the Makefile. 
 (5)   Inside this subdirectory, just type >make,  it will make the xxx.uspp 
       pseudopotential file for you. You can copy the uspp.atom in the Pot file 
       for you future use. Only the atom_ae_ref.adat (e.g, ag_ae_ref.adat) and 
       atom_ps.adat (e.g, ag_ps.adat) are used in >make. All the other files are 
       used in >make test. But it is a good idea to download all the files.  

       You can also try: >make install, >make clean, >make test.   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       Note the following notation convention when you choose different pseudopotentials:

To find the potential of interest to you, move to the subdirectory
for the atom of interest.  Within each atom directory, there are
further subdirectories with a naming structure of the form

  nnn-Sy-xc-[nspdf]-label

where

  nnn-Sy is the atomic number and symbol

  xc is the type of exchange-correlation, which can be:

      ca   Ceperley-Alder
      wg   Wigner
      hl   Hedin-Lundquist
      gl   Gunnarson-Lundquist
      gbl  LDA (CA) + Becke88 + LYP GC xc
      gb   LDA (CA) + Becke88
      gbp  LDA (CA) + Becke88 + Perdew86 GC xc
      gpw  PW(91)
      gpbe PBE(96)

  [nspdf] is one or more of:

      n    Non-linear core correction included
      s    Semicore s shell included in valence
      p    Semicore p shell included in valence
      d    Semicore d shell included in valence
      f    Semicore f shell included in valence

  label is a unique label provided by the supplier of the potential

Examples:

  022-Ti-ca-sp-vgrp     Ti Ceperley-Alder potential with semicore s and p
  008-O-gpbe--marz01    Oxygen PBE potential with no semicore states
