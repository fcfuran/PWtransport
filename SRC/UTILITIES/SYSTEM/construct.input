******************************************
Note, in terms of the electrode range [1,n1e], ipL should be at 1, and ipR should be at n1e.  
      The nnL, nnR are the number of electrode n1e units outside the [ipL,ipR]. 
      iadd_L is the addition grid point (can be + or -) at the left end. This is used to have a proper total n1 for FFT
      So, the whole system looks like: [1,iadd_L]+nnL*n1e+[ipL,ipR]+nnR*n1e
      total n1=nnL*n1e+iadd_L+(ipR-ipL+1)+nnR*n1e

      abs(iadd_L).le.n1e/2

      dcut is used only when iadd_L.ne.0, then dcut is used to determine when the atom (nonlocal potential) 
      is going to be included at the left end (when the electrode is extended by iadd_L), 
      the shortest distance in x direction between two atomic planes is dcut. The sensible choice of dcut depends
      on what kind of two planes are approaching together around x=0. So, check the resulting xatom.system 

      Note, the user should check xatom.system by him/her self for the first plane atoms near x=0, just to see 
      whether it is okay to include them etc, and whether they overlap with the atoms near x=1.
